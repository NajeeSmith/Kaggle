# Kaggle
Respository for Kaggle competitions I attempted utilizing the techniques I have learned thusfar.

Currently the only challenge I have attempted was for an animal shelter in S.E. Asia to predict the speed in which certain animals get adopted. In my first attempt, I utilized NLP since there were throuough descriptions of each animals, however I found the accuracy to be incredibly low around 20%. I then employed other techniques such as XGBoost and found greater results, but the accuracy was still relatively low at 30%. This can be improved through parameter tuning.
